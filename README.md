<h1>Products App ðŸ¤–</h1>
Products-app is a demo of an online store catalog that allows you to search for items by title and view the details of a selected item.

It's developed with ReactJS and it contains 2 routes:

1. **Search Page:** Allows customers to find the items according to their search.
2. **Not Found**: When you visit other URL than "/" you can see the Not Found message.

The searcher is using RxJs in order to avoid the filtering when the user type a letter and also use a debounce to avoid multiple executions.
